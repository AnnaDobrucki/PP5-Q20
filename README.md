## Sections and Apps

### **Dnd Events** 
* This app for events, was created to link up with my fornt end app, and collect, store and return to origin the data that's created about making DND Events.
* This meant I created the ability to know when a user is logged in, order posts due to there created at ID's, and included dates, times, and descriptions (text box input fields) of what was going on in this event.

### **Replies**

* Coinciding DND Events is my replies app, to allow users to state theirinterest in a particular game/ event. Which in turn will hopefully rally more support and people!


### **Posts**

* This based upoon the Code Institute modle walkthrough, is to allow logged in users to post their every thought or comment on others posts. Here is where people can state there love or hate (or out right appathy) for anything dnd.
* Logged in users are able to connect to this API, to use CRUD functionality. Allowing our users a seemless transition of data form Front to Back end. Giving them full control over Creating/Reading/Updating/Deleting there own content.
